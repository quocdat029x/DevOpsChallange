### Cloud Service Choices and Reasons

---

#### 1. **Front-End: Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront**
- **Why Chosen**:
    - **Amazon S3**: Provides scalable, durable, and secure object storage for static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It is cost-effective and integrates seamlessly with CloudFront for efficient content delivery.
    - **Amazon CloudFront**: Acts as a global content delivery network (CDN) to cache and deliver content from edge locations, reducing latency for users worldwide. This is crucial for ensuring fast load times and handling high request volumes.
---

#### 2. **API Management: Amazon API Gateway**
- **Why Chosen**:
    - API Gateway is a fully managed service that handles API request routing, scaling, and security. It integrates directly with Lambda and EC2, supports caching, and enforces API throttling and authorization, which are essential for maintaining fast response times.
---

#### 3. **Business Logic: AWS Lambda and Amazon EC2**
- **Why Chosen**:
    - **Amazon EC2 (Matching Engine)**: Necessary for running the matching engine, which requires maintaining in-memory state for the order book. EC2 provides the flexibility to run custom applications and is supported by Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for scalability and high availability.
---

#### 4. **Order Book Storage: Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)**
- **Why Chosen**:
    - ElastiCache with Redis provides an in-memory data store, which is critical for achieving the low-latency performance required for real-time order matching. It ensures fast response times by minimizing disk I/O operations.
---

#### 5. **Database: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**
- **Why Chosen**:
    - RDS with PostgreSQL is used for storing user data, transaction history, and other persistent information. It offers robust relational database capabilities, supports complex queries, and provides high availability through multi-AZ deployments.

---

#### 6. **User Management: Amazon Cognito**
- **Why Chosen**:
    - Cognito provides a managed solution for user authentication and authorization, integrating seamlessly with API Gateway. It handles user registration, login, and access control, reducing development overhead and ensuring security.
---

#### 7. **Notifications: Amazon SNS and API Gateway Websockets**
- **Why Chosen**:
    - **Amazon SNS**: Used for sending email and SMS notifications, which are reliable and scalable for asynchronous communication.
    - **API Gateway Websockets**: Enable real-time, bidirectional communication for live updates (e.g., order status, market data), ensuring low-latency delivery of critical information.
---

#### 8. **Monitoring: Amazon CloudWatch**
- **Why Chosen**:
    - CloudWatch provides a unified platform for collecting metrics, logs, and setting alarms across all AWS services. It is essential for monitoring system performance and ensuring the system meets performance requirements.
